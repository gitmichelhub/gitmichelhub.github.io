I grew up right next to the baltic see in germany, so I got to experience early on that a beach is very important for life quality. Being on or next to water is great! 

That is also part of a reason why I try to enjoy the summer months every year. Having longer days and a surplus of sunlight (& Vitamin D) improves productivity a great deal. Exercise is also more fun. Did you know there is a correlation regarding CEOs that do heavy lifting and market valuation? Someone created an ETF based on this correlation!
