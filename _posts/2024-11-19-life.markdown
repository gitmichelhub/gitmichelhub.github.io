I grew up right next to the baltic see in germany, so I got to experience early on that a beach is very important for life quality. Being on or next to water is great! 

That is also part of a reason why I try to enjoy the summer months every year. Having longer days and a surplus of sunlight (& Vitamin D) improves productivity a great deal. Exercise is also more fun. Did you know there is a correlation regarding CEOs that do heavy lifting and market valuation? Truflation created an ETF based on this correlation and it is outperforming many other ETFs and even the S&P 500: [Deadlift Index](https://truflation.com/marketplace/deadlift-index)

In winter, I still prioritize getting outside and maximizing sun exposure, even though it's more challenging during the shorter days. Being in an area with snow can be incredibly relaxing - the white landscape creates a peaceful atmosphere that helps clear the mind. One of my favorite winter activities is snowboarding in the mountains, which combines the thrill of the sport with breathtaking alpine views. But since I am not living in the alps I am completely fine with going for a walk during the winter months to get my daily dose of fresh air and sunlight.
